        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>
          I’m currently a 19-year-old university student learning programming and exploring different areas of software development. Each day, I’m focused on improving my skills and understanding how technology shapes the world around us.
        </p>

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
          Living in Albania, balancing my studies with self-learning, and staying motivated to grow as a developer. I enjoy the process of learning something new every day — whether it’s coding, solving problems, or simply figuring things out one step at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>Doing</h2>
        <p>
          Spending time on the court, diving deeper into cinema, and exploring
          AI and emerging technologies through hands-on experimentation.
          Building things that solve real problems while staying curious about
          the world beyond the screen.
